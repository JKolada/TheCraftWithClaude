# AI_README — The Craft directory map

> Directory map for the next session / another agent. Read it **before** touching any files here.
> Repo constitution: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Quality test for this file: after reading it, can you
> safely change anything in this directory without scanning every file?
>
> **Meta-file split** (→ [01](01-documentation-and-ai-readme.md)): `README.md` = description for GitHub
> (public, EN). `CLAUDE.md` = repo constitution (single language, **not translated**). **`AI_README` is
> translated per language** — this file (root) is the **EN/base** version; the PL copy lives in [`pl/AI_README.md`](pl/AI_README.md).

## What this directory is

A **documentation** repository (not an application): the "Rzemiosło — The Craft" doctrine (Kolada Build).
The content is hand-written markdown; `index.html` is its viewer (a static SPA, no build step).
Goal: a rule set reusable as `/docs/rules/` in new projects **and** public material for
people starting out with Claude. Details and policies → [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Core (this repo) vs Web (sibling repo)

**Split of responsibilities — do not duplicate between them:**

- **This repo (`ClaudeBuildCodex`, the "Rzemiosło" brand) = canonical core.** Form: **technical, terse, imperative;
  English is the base** (PL translation in `pl/`) — the source of truth for the rules, attached to projects as `/docs/rules/`. Optimized for
  **the agent and the technical reader**: density over approachability. This is where we version the doctrine (codex.json).
- **The sibling `ClaudeBuildCodexWeb` (the "Rzemiosło Web" brand) = the presentation project.** It takes the same doctrine and **expands
  individual topics** into a friendlier, more extensive form. **Web — not this repo — is responsible for:**
  the public site, **editions** (technical / BIZ-TECH / business), **language versions**, and **building
  `docs/rules/` packages in a specific language**. It consumes this repo's content + `codex.json` at build time.

> **This repo is ONLY a rule set.** It is not a presentation product. The `index.html` here is a
> **minimal local/dev reader** (content preview for the author and agent), **not** a public site —
> which is why we don't put edition badges, marketing, or a language switcher here. All presentation,
> editions, and multi-language packaging happen in **The Craft Web** (a separate project). If you're tempted
> to add a presentation/marketing/edition layer here — that's material for Web, not for the core.

Direction for the EN version and per-language packaging → [docs/plans/0001-i18n-and-packaging.md](docs/plans/0001-i18n-and-packaging.md).

## File index

| File | What it's for |
|------|----------|
| `index.html` | **Minimal local/dev reader** (content preview for the author/agent) — NOT a public site. Home page (decalogue + cards) + chapter view + brief + EN/PL language switcher (EN by default). |
| `intro.md` | **Manifesto** — "What The Craft is" + a "why it's worth it" article. A special document (outside the numbered list), routed as `#intro`; there's also `pl/intro.md`. |
| `00`–`15` (root) | **EN content — canonical, base, source of truth.** Slugs/numbers = stable anchors, shared across all languages. |
| `pl/` | **PL content** — a parallel set of `00-*.md`…`15-*.md` (the same file names, content in Polish). Translation of the EN. |
| `docs/` | Plans and meta decisions for the repo (not doctrine content): `docs/AI_README.md`, `docs/plans/`. |
| `content.js` | **Generated** snapshot of the `.md` embedded in JS — lets content render over `file://`. Do not edit by hand. |
| `build.py` | Build script: concatenates `.md` files → `content.js`. Run after editing content (`python build.py`). |
| `test.py` | **Smoke test** (pure Python): PL↔EN parity, dead links, `content.js` freshness, consistency of `CHAPTERS`/tables/`codex.json`, and **static `index.html` navigation** (`href="#…"` links, `data-i18n`↔`UI`, `data-bf-label`↔`BRIEF_FIELDS`). `python test.py`. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Repo constitution: what it is, the stack, how to run it, policies, current state. |
| `AI_README.md` | This file — the directory map. |
| `README.md` | Entry point for a human: chapter list + "how to read it". |
| `codex.json` | **Release version** (`version` + `released`) + brand names (`name`/`name_short`/`name_en`). The source of the stamp for the Rzemiosło Web site. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Rzemiosło release history (semver, date = publication day). |
| `00-commandments.md` | **Decalogue** — 10 commandments, 7 sins, the golden rule of altitude. The core. |
| `01-documentation-and-ai-readme.md` | Three layers of docs: CLAUDE.md / AI_README / docs. When to update them. |
| `02-skills-and-refactoring.md` | When to build a skill/slash-command; refactoring discipline; SOLID (with feature flags and separate-the-layers). |
| `03-testing-and-verification.md` | Test pyramid, "verify, don't declare", smoke. |
| `04-scripts-and-databases.md` | Dry-run/`--execute`, idempotency, forward-only migrations, backups. |
| `05-git-and-deployments.md` | Search in git, tag deploys, swap the database while preserving accounts. The densest chapter. |
| `06-collaboration-and-memory.md` | Plan→iterate→review, memory, confirm the irreversible, report honestly. |
| `07-new-project-day-0.md` | "Day 0" checklist: product brief (language, features, monetization, UX, animations, marketing) + repo setup. |
| `08-stack-and-technologies.md` | Universal stack: Python, databases, web/API, Docker, servers (Hetzner) + TDD as the hard core. |
| `09-law-and-protecting-the-creator.md` | Terms, privacy policy, disclaimers as protection for the creator / sole proprietorship. |
| `10-seo-and-translations.md` | hreflang, JSON-LD, E-E-A-T/YMYL, language parity as a test. |
| `11-data-model-and-normalization.md` | Lookup dictionaries, slug instead of ID, active-row, deliberate denormalization. |
| `12-flexibility-and-scalability.md` | Separate the layers, feature flags, scale-to-zero vs always-on, don't over-engineer. |
| `13-performance-frontend-and-sql.md` | Measure first, indexes + partial index, no N+1, chat streaming, CWV. |
| `14-operational-resilience.md` | Crash-proof runtime, resumable jobs, unreliable APIs (backoff/rotation), provider limits + email, cost quotas. |
| `15-scraping-ai-and-chatbots.md` | Effective scraping (official source, shape validation, delta), AI APIs for specific tasks (contract/cache/quotas), configurable+grounded chatbots. |
| `16-driving-claude.md` | Operating Claude Code: skills/slash-commands, picking the model, autopilot (preferred), background jobs, agentic workflows/subagents. |

The chapters split into a **core** (`00`–`08`) and a **deep dive** (`09`–`16`). Each = one
commandment/topic, terse, ending with anti-patterns.

## Topic index → file (grep-friendly)

> **Looking for something specific? Don't read everything.** `grep -i <topic>` over this index (English
> keywords) → the file name on the same line → read **only that chapter**. That's how you save context in
> the target project (rule: [01](01-documentation-and-ai-readme.md)).
> **Native language:** a translation may live in a language subfolder (e.g. `pl/`, with its own
> `AI_README.md` and keywords in that language). If the user's native language is available there, read
> that copy — the file slug is shared across all languages.

## `index.html` architecture (contract)

A single file, no build dependencies. Mechanics:

- **`CHAPTERS`** (an array in `<script>`) — **the single source** of the chapter list. From it are generated:
  the cards on the home page, the `<select>` in the reader, prev/next navigation. Fields: `file, no, group
  ("core"|"deep"), title, desc`.
- **Hash routing:** `#NN-name` → chapter view; empty/`#` → home page. `route()`
  reacts to `hashchange`.
- **Language (content + the whole chrome):** `LANG` (`en`/`pl`, default **`en`**, saved in `localStorage` `rzemioslo-lang`).
  Chapter content from `file` (EN, root) or `pl/`+`file` (PL). **The chrome is fully bilingual** —
  the `UI` dictionary (`data-i18n`/`data-i18n-html`) + `CH_EN` (chapter titles/descriptions) + `BRIEF_FIELDS`
  (brief fields); `applyChrome()` redraws everything at startup and on `#langToggle`. Add a
  string to the chrome → add a key to `UI` (both languages), otherwise it stays in Polish.
- **Render (two-track):** first `fetch(langPath(file))` (fresh `.md`, when served); on a fetch
  error (`file://`) — the `window.RZEMIOSLO_DOCS[LANG][slug]` snapshot from `content.js`. The result →
  `marked.parse()` → `.prose`, cached in memory (`cache[LANG+":"+file]`).
- **`rewriteLinks()`** after render: `*.md` links → `#slug` (SPA navigation), `index.html` → `#`,
  external `http(s)` → `target=_blank`; tables wrapped in `.tablewrap` for scrolling on mobile.
- **Theme:** `[data-theme]` on `<html>` (`light`/`dark`); no attribute = follow the system. The switcher
  in the topbar saves the choice in `localStorage` (`rzemioslo-theme`); a script in `<head>` sets it
  before render (no flash).
- **Fallback note** shows only when **both** sources fail (no `content.js` and `file://`).

## Gotchas

- **`file://` blocks `fetch`** — which is why content works from a double-click **only** from the
  `content.js` snapshot. After editing `.md` run `python build.py`, otherwise `file://` will show stale content.
  When served (`http(s)://`, GitHub Pages) it always takes the fresh `.md`; on GitHub the `.md` renders natively.
- **`content.js` is generated** — don't edit it by hand (the build will overwrite it). Commit it so `file://`
  works after the repo is cloned.
- **`marked` is loaded from a CDN** — without network the render won't work (there's a soft fallback to `<pre>`).
- **`index.html` does NOT contain chapter content** — it reads `.md`/`content.js`. Don't paste content into the HTML.
- **Add/change a chapter → sync 3 places + build:** `CHAPTERS` (index.html), the table
  in `README.md`, the table in this file, then `python build.py`. A mismatch = a dead entry (worse than none).
- **EN↔PL parity:** changing a rule in `00`–`15` (EN, canon) requires updating the counterpart in `pl/` (the same
  list, the same file names). PL is a **translation**, not a separate doctrine. `content.js` holds both languages.
- **File names = stable anchors** (`#NN-name`, targets of relative links), **shared between EN and PL**.
  We don't localize file names — only the content inside. Don't change them without reason.
- **Brand:** make color changes on the CSS variables (`--accent`, `--accent-2`, `--grad`), not on the
  values at the point of use. Light and dark mode must both look good.
- **Content is generic, not "for one project".** Specific projects serve
  only as illustration (`e.g. …`, "reference project"), never as the topic. Don't make any project the hero of the doctrine.
- **Two languages: EN (canon, root, base) + PL (`pl/`).** Write rules translatably. Direction and convention →
  [docs/plans/0001-i18n-and-packaging.md](docs/plans/0001-i18n-and-packaging.md). Per-language packages are assembled by Web.

## Numbers

- 17 chapters (`00`–`16`) + `README.md`, in **two languages** (EN root = base + PL `pl/`).
  Core: 9 files (00–08). Deep dive: 7 (09–15).
- `index.html`: 1 file; runtime from a CDN (`marked` + Google Fonts). Build: `build.py` → `content.js`
  (EN: 19 docs ~110k chars; PL: 18 docs ~102k chars — chapters + `intro` + README; structure `{lang:{slug:md}}`).
- **Special documents (outside the numbered list):** `intro.md` (manifesto, route `#intro`) and the
  brief view (`#brief`) — routed separately, not present in the `CHAPTERS` array.
- **Smoke test:** `python test.py` (PL↔EN parity, dead links, `content.js` freshness, consistency of
  `CHAPTERS`/tables/`codex.json`, static `index.html` navigation: `href="#…"` links + `data-i18n`↔`UI` +
  `data-bf-label`↔`BRIEF_FIELDS`). Plus a "manual test" = preview via a server **and** from a double-click
  (`file://`) + clicking through chapters and the EN/PL switcher (runtime JS behavior the smoke test doesn't catch).
