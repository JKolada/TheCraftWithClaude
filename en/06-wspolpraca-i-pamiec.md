# 06 — Collaboration and Memory

> Commandments VI and X: how we work together and how we keep from losing context.

## Collaboration style (user + Claude)

- **Plan → iterate → review.** First show a plan or a **small sketch** (3 examples, not 100),
  gather feedback, then scale. OG cards in the reference project: 3 → fixes → 10 → fixes
  → 100. Never the other way around.
- **Recommend, don't fan out an umbrella of options.** When weighing a choice — give a
  **recommendation** with reasoning, not an exhaustive list you won't act on anyway. Ask only when
  the answer genuinely changes what you do next (and when it doesn't follow from the code/a sensible default).
- **Verify numbers at the source** — not from memory, not from docs.
- **UX with warmth.** Correctness is the minimum; the product should be pleasant. Aesthetics and tone
  matter (especially in sensitive products: minimalist, but warm).
- **Language:** PL in conversation and changelog, EN in code/commits/technical docs — the way we
  naturally work. Technical terms in English within Polish text are fine.
- **Separate unrelated things** — in commits and in thinking. One topic at a time.

## Confirm what's irreversible and "external"

Actions hard to undo or reaching beyond the machine — **confirm first**, unless you have standing
authorization or an explicit "do it without asking":
- prod deploy, sending emails, publishing content, deleting/overwriting data.
- **Consent in one context does not carry over to the next.** "Deploy X" ≠ "deploy everything, always".
- **Before you delete/overwrite — look at the target.** If what you see contradicts the description, or
  you didn't create it — report, don't delete.
- Publishing to an external service = content may get indexed/cached, even after deletion.

## Memory (cross-session)

The agent's file-based memory (`memory/`) holds what **can't be read from the code/git**:
- **who the user is** (role, preferences), **feedback** (how I should work — with the "why"),
  **project state** not derivable from the repo, **pointers** to resources (URLs, dashboards, issues).
- **Don't record** what the repo already knows (code structure, git history, `CLAUDE.md`).
  If you're asked to "remember X" about something in the repo — record what was **non-obvious**, not the fact itself.
- **Relative dates → absolute** ("next week" → a concrete date).
- Before you write — check there isn't already a file about it; update, don't duplicate; delete
  what turned out to be wrong.
- **Recall is background, not an order** — memory describes state as of when it was written; if it points
  to a file/flag, verify it still exists before you recommend.

## Reporting (Commandment III, once more, because it matters most)
The facts > a good impression. "Tests failed — here's the output." "A step was skipped." "Done and
verified" — without hedging, when truly verified.

## Anti-patterns
- 🚫 Scaling before review.
- 🚫 A survey of options instead of a recommendation.
- 🚫 Overwriting/deleting without looking at the target.
- 🚫 Memory as a dumping ground for facts from the repo.
- 🚫 Treating one-time consent as standing.
