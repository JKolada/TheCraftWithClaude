# The Craft — Rzemiosło <sub>(Kolada Build)</sub>

> **The art of building end-to-end applications with Claude** — scalable, maintainable, and easy to
> evolve, migrate, and change. Not a framework or a library: a **human + agent doctrine** — a tight set
> of rules, commandments, and anti-patterns that keep a project understandable, testable, safe to change,
> and trustworthy, from the first commit to production with real users.

New here? Read the manifesto: **[What The Craft is](intro.md)** · or the whole doctrine on one screen:
**[00 — Decalogue](00-commandments.md)**.

## Adopt it in your project

The Craft is meant to be dropped into a project as `docs/rules/`, so the agent reads it from Day 0:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/JKolada/TheCraftWithClaude docs/rules
# or just copy the files into docs/rules/
```

Then point your project's `CLAUDE.md` at it (full steps → [07 — New project: Day 0](07-new-project-day-0.md)):

> **Read `docs/rules/` every session — it is the build doctrine (The Craft).** For a specific topic,
> `grep -i <keyword>` over `docs/rules/AI_README.md` → the right chapter; read only that one.

## Languages

**English is the base** — the canonical doctrine lives in the repo root. **Polski** is a 1:1 translation
under [`pl/`](pl/00-commandments.md) (same chapters, same filenames). The in-browser reader
([index.html](index.html)) renders the `.md` and has an **EN | PL** switch (default EN). On GitHub the
`.md` files render natively — just click the links below.

## The philosophy in one sentence

> **Build like a craftsman — slow where a mistake is expensive, fast where it's cheap; and leave behind a
> workshop where the next person (human or agent) immediately knows where everything is.**
